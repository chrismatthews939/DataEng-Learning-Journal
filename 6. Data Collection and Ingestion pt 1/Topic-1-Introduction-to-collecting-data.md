### Data collection

Data collection is the process of gathering raw data from various sources and compiling it into a central location for analysis.

It is typically the first step in the data analysis process.

### Data ingestion

Data ingestion is the process of taking data from various sources and setting it up for analysis.

This can involve data preparation and automation, so that data can be easily and repeatedly analysed.

### Data preparation

Data preparation involves cleaning, transforming and organising data so that it is in the right shape for your analysis.

### The key difference between data collection and ingestion are as follows:

- **Data collection** involves gathering raw data from various sources, whereas **data ingestion** involves processing and preparing data for analysis.
- **Data collection** is typically a one-time process, whereas **data ingestion** can be an ongoing process.
- **Data collection** can involve manual entry of data, while **data ingestion** is typically an automated process.
- **Data collection** can be a time-consuming and resource-intensive process, while **data ingestion** can be faster and more efficient.
- **Data collection** is often done in a decentralised manner, while **data ingestion** can be centralised.
