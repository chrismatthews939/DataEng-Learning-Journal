# Topic 4 - Monitoring an ingestion service and anomaly detection techniques 02/06/2025

## The importance of monitoring in data engineering

In modern data-driven organisations, data ingestion pipelines are critical components that must operate reliably and efficiently. Monitoring these pipelines is essential to:

-	**Ensure data integrity:** Detect and prevent data loss or corruption.
-	**Maintain performance:** Identify bottlenecks and optimise resource utilisation.
-	**Enhance reliability:** Quickly detect and respond to system failures or anomalies.
-	**Support compliance:** Meet regulatory requirements for data handling and reporting.

**Logs** are records of events
**Metrics** are used to measure performance
**Alerts** notifications of issues
**Dashboards** visualise performance

## Forecasting techniques for data ingestion

One of the key challenges faced by data engineers is predicting future system behaviour to ensure that resources are allocated efficiently and potential issues are mitigated before they escalate. Forecasting is a critical component in managing data ingestion services. By predicting future system behaviour, you can plan capacity, prevent overloads, and optimise costs.

Forecasting is a critical component in managing data ingestion services. By predicting future system behaviour, you can:

1.	**Plan capacity:** Ensure that resources meet demand.
2.	**Prevent overload:** Avoid system failures due to unexpected spikes.
3.	**Optimise costs:** Allocate resources efficiently.

### Introduction to time series forecasting

Time series forecasting involves analysing historical data to predict future values. Common methods include:

-	**ARIMA** (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average)
-	**SARIMAX** (Seasonal AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average with eXogenous regressors)
-	**Prophet**
-	**Machine Learning Models** (e.g., LSTM networks)

`A stationary time series is a time series whose statistical properties, such as mean, variance, and autocorrelation, do not change over time. In other words, the value of a stationary time series is not dependent on the time at which it is observed.`

### Real-world application

**Capacity planning for a streaming service**
A music streaming company wants to forecast the expected data ingestion rates to ensure that their Kafka cluster can handle peak loads, especially during events like new album releases or holidays.

**As the lead data engineer, how would you set about forecasting the data ingestion rates?**
Your implementation steps would be as follows:

1.	**Collect historical data:**
-	Gather ingestion metrics over the past year.
2.	**Apply SARIMAX Model:**
-	Account for seasonal patterns (e.g., higher usage on weekends).
-	Include exogenous variables like marketing campaigns.
3.	**Forecast future demand:**
-	Predict ingestion rates for the next quarter.
4.	**Plan Infrastructure:**
-	Scale Kafka clusters and allocate resources accordingly.

**The benefits**

-	**Optimised performance:** Prevent overloads and ensure smooth user experience.
-	**Cost efficiency:** Avoid over-provisioning resources, reducing operational costs.
-	**Strategic planning:** Align technical capacity with business initiatives.

## Anomaly detection in data streams

### Anomaly detection techniques

#### Statistical methods
**Z-Score Analysis:**
-	Measures how many standard deviations an element is from the mean.
**Seasonal Hybrid ESD (Extreme Studentised Deviate):**
-	Detects anomalies in seasonal time series data.

#### Machine learning models
**Isolation Forest:**
-	An unsupervised learning algorithm that isolates anomalies based on random partitioning.
**One-Class SVM (Support Vector Machine):**
-	Learns the boundary of normal data to detect outliers.

#### Time series models
**ARIMA/SARIMAX Residual Analysis:**
-	Analyse residuals from forecasting models to detect anomalies.
**Prophet:**
-	A forecasting tool by Facebook that can model and detect anomalies in time series data.

## Integration with Incident Management Systems

Incident management systems play a vital role in helping organisations respond to and manage unplanned events or service interruptions.

**Popular incident management platforms include:**
-	PagerDuty
-	Opsgenie
-	VictorOps
-	ServiceNow

**The benefits of integration include:**

-	**Centralised alert management:** Consolidate alerts from multiple sources.
-	**On-Call scheduling:** Manage on-call rotations and escalations.
-	**Automated response:** Trigger automated actions or workflows.
-	**Incident tracking:** Log incidents for analysis and improvement.

### Real-world application

**Managing incidents in a healthcare system...**

A hospital uses data ingestion services to process patient data in real-time.
System failures can have critical implications for patient care.
As the lead data engineer, how would you set about implementing an incident management system?

Your implementation steps would be as follows:

1.	**Integrate monitoring with incident management:**
-	Use Prometheus and Alertmanager to monitor ingestion services.
-	Connect Alertmanager to PagerDuty for incident management.
2.	**Define critical alerts:**
-	Set up alerts for high-severity issues like data ingestion failures or significant anomalies.
3.	**Configure on-call rotations:**
-	Ensure that responsible team members are available to respond to incidents promptly.
4.	**Automate responses:**
-	Implement scripts or playbooks that can be triggered to mitigate issues automatically.

#### The benefits
-	**Response times:** Faster resolution of incidents reduces impact on services.
-	**Accountability:** Clear ownership of incidents ensures that issues are addressed.
-	**Continuous improvement:** Incident tracking allows for analysis and process enhancements.

## Addressing real-world use cases and typical ingestion issues

### Common ingestion issues in Kafka and Cloud environments
Data ingestion pipelines can encounter several common issues that impact their performance and reliability. In this section, we'll delve into problems like consumer lag and latency, broker failures, message loss, and security breaches. Understanding the symptoms, causes, and solutions for these issues will help you maintain a robust data ingestion system.

#### Consumer lag and latency

**Symptoms**
-	Consumers fall behind the latest messages.
-	Increased message processing delays.
