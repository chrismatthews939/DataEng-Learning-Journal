### Linux in action (Mars rover mission)
The rovers send back a continuous stream of data, including images, environmental readings, and scientific measurements. This data must be transmitted over vast distances, processed, and analysed quickly. Linux systems manage this entire process, from the initial reception of data at ground stations to its analysis and storage. NASA extensively uses the Linux system for various technical applications, including:

- **Data processing**: Engineers use CLI tools to process raw data from space missions. Commands such as **grep, awk, and sed** help in filtering and transforming data efficiently, which is essential for extracting meaningful information from vast datasets.

- **System monitoring**: Monitoring the health and performance of computational clusters is critical. CLI tools like top, htop, and dstat provide real-time insights into system resource usage, helping engineers to maintain system stability and performance.

- **Automation**: Automation is key in handling repetitive tasks and managing complex workflows. Shell scripting in Linux allows NASA to automate data processing pipelines, reducing manual intervention and increasing efficiency.
 
Linux systems are known for their stability and reliability, capable of running for extended periods without requiring a reboot. This is crucial in server environments where uptime and consistency are paramount. Imagine the importance of a web server that needs to be accessible 24/7â€”Linux can handle such demands efficiently. Security is another significant advantage of Linux. Due to its open-source nature, a global community of developers continuously scrutinises the code, identifying and addressing vulnerabilities swiftly. This collaborative approach ensures that security patches and updates are rolled out promptly, helping to protect systems against potential threats. For data engineers handling sensitive information, the security features of Linux provide an added layer of confidence.

Flexibility is also a hallmark of Linux. It can be customised to meet specific needs, making it a versatile choice for various applications. From lightweight installations suitable for embedded systems to robust configurations designed for high-performance computing, Linux adapts to diverse requirements. This flexibility extends to the wide range of distributions available, such as Ubuntu, CentOS, and Debian, each offering unique features tailored to different use cases. Moreover, Linux supports a vast array of software tools and frameworks essential for data engineering. Whether it is for data processing, analysis, or visualisation, Linux's compatibility with tools like Hadoop, Apache Spark, and TensorFlow makes it an invaluable asset in the data engineer's toolkit.
