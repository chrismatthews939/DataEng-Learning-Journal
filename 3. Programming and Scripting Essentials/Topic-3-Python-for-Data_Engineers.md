## Introduction to the Software Development Lifecycle

### Software development lifecycle SDLC

**Planning**
- **Definition**: This initial phase involves defining the scope and purpose of the project, identifying stakeholders, and setting objectives.

- **Examples**: Gathering requirements from clients, defining project timelines, and resource allocation.

- **Role of Data Engineering**: Data engineers may be involved in assessing data needs, understanding data sources, and planning for data integration and storage solutions.

**Analysis**
- **Definition**: During the analysis phase, detailed requirements are gathered and analysed to create a comprehensive project specification.

- **Examples**: Conducting feasibility studies, defining functional and non-functional requirements.

- **Role of Data Engineering**: Data engineers analyse data requirements, ensure data quality, and design data models that meet the project needs.
  
**Design**
- **Definition**: The design phase focuses on creating the architecture and detailed design of the software based on the requirements gathered.

- **Examples**: System architecture design, user interface design, database schema design.

- **Role of Data Engineering**: Data engineers design the data architecture, including database schemas, ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processes, and data pipelines.

**Development**
- **Definition**: In this phase, actual coding takes place. Developers write the code to implement the designed functionalities.

- **Examples**: Writing code, developing algorithms, creating user interfaces.

- **Role of Data Engineering**: Data engineers develop the data infrastructure, implement ETL processes, and create data pipelines to ensure data flows smoothly across the system.

**Testing**
- **Definition**: The testing phase involves verifying that the software works as intended and identifying any defects.

- **Examples**: Unit testing, integration testing, system testing, user acceptance testing.

- **Role of Data Engineering**: Data engineers test data flows, validate data accuracy and integrity, and ensure that data processing meets performance requirements.

**Deployment**
- **Definition**: Once testing is complete, the software is deployed to a production environment where it becomes available to users.

- **Examples**: Once testing is complete, the software is deployed to a production environment where it becomes available to users.

- **Role of Data Engineering**: Data engineers ensure that data systems are correctly deployed, migrate data if necessary, and verify that data systems are operational in the production environment.

## Introduction to Python basics
Did you know that Python's simple and readable syntax has made it one of the most popular programming languages, used by tech giants like Google and NASA? Understanding the basics of Python can open doors to a wide range of applications in web development, data science, artificial intelligence, and more. This lesson will cover essential Python concepts such as syntax, variables, functions, reserved keywords, program structure, control flow, recursion, and functions. The illustration below outlines the features provided by Python:

**Syntax**
Syntax refers to the set of rules that defines the combinations of symbols considered correctly structured programs in a programming language. In Python, syntax is designed to be easy to read and write, making it an excellent choice for beginners and experienced programmers alike. For instance, unlike some other programming languages, Python uses indentation to define code blocks rather than braces or keywords, which enhances readability. 

**Variables**
Variables are used to store data that can be referenced and manipulated in a program. In Python, you do not need to declare a variable before using it, and the variable's type is determined automatically at runtime. This flexibility allows for rapid development and prototyping.

**Functions**
Functions are reusable blocks of code that perform a specific task. They help in organising code, making it modular, and avoiding repetition. Defining a function in Python is straightforward using the def keyword, followed by the function name and parentheses.

**Reserved keywords**
Reserved keywords are special words that are part of the Python language syntax and have specific meanings. They cannot be used as identifiers such as variable names, function names, or any other user-defined item.

**Program structure**
The structure of a Python program refers to how the code is organised and written, ensuring it is clean, understandable, and maintainable. Python relies on indentation to define code blocks, which is critical for readability and functionality. Consistent indentation is not just a matter of style but a syntactic requirement. Additionally, comments are used to explain code, making it easier to understand and maintain.

**Control flow**
Control flow refers to the order in which individual statements, instructions, or function calls are executed or evaluated in a Python program. Control flow structures include conditional statements and loops, which allow for decision-making and the repetitive execution of code. Conditional statements like if, elif, and else are used to execute code based on specific conditions.

**Recursion**
Recursion is a technique where a function calls itself to solve a problem. Each recursive call reduces the problem size, bringing it closer to a base case, which stops the recursion. Recursion can simplify the solution of complex problems by breaking them down into simpler sub-problems.
