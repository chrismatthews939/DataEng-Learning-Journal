## Introduction to Python basics

**Syntax**
Syntax refers to the set of rules that defines the combinations of symbols considered correctly structured programs in a programming language. In Python, syntax is designed to be easy to read and write, making it an excellent choice for beginners and experienced programmers alike. For instance, unlike some other programming languages, Python uses indentation to define code blocks rather than braces or keywords, which enhances readability. 

**Variables**
Variables are used to store data that can be referenced and manipulated in a program. In Python, you do not need to declare a variable before using it, and the variable's type is determined automatically at runtime. This flexibility allows for rapid development and prototyping.

**Functions**
Functions are reusable blocks of code that perform a specific task. They help in organising code, making it modular, and avoiding repetition. Defining a function in Python is straightforward using the def keyword, followed by the function name and parentheses.

**Reserved keywords**
Reserved keywords are special words that are part of the Python language syntax and have specific meanings. They cannot be used as identifiers such as variable names, function names, or any other user-defined item.
