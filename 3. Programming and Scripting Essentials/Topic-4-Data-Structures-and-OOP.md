## Getting started with Python

**IDEs**
**Visual Studio Code (VSCode)**
Microsofts Product. Good all rounder

**PyCharm**
PyCharm is a Python-focused IDE with a rich feature set for professional development, including debugging and version control. It's heavier on system resources compared to VSCode but provides a more out-of-the-box, Python-optimised experience.

Difference from VSCode: PyCharm offers an all-in-one solution tailored specifically for Python development, requiring less configuration and extension installation compared to the more general-purpose VSCode.

**Spyder**
Spyder is an IDE primarily geared towards scientists and data analysts, featuring built-in support for scientific Python libraries. It has an interactive console and variable explorer ideal for data manipulation and analysis. Itâ€™s typically packaged with Anaconda. 

While VSCode is extensible and supports multiple languages, Spyder is specifically optimised for scientific computing in Python, offering features like a variable explorer that are less common in general-purpose editors like VSCode.

**Jupyter Notebook**
Web application. Gives more of a front end to see the code running or display graphs etc.





**Syntax**
Syntax refers to the set of rules that defines the combinations of symbols considered correctly structured programs in a programming language. In Python, syntax is designed to be easy to read and write, making it an excellent choice for beginners and experienced programmers alike. For instance, unlike some other programming languages, Python uses indentation to define code blocks rather than braces or keywords, which enhances readability. 

**Variables**
Variables are used to store data that can be referenced and manipulated in a program. In Python, you do not need to declare a variable before using it, and the variable's type is determined automatically at runtime. This flexibility allows for rapid development and prototyping.

**Functions**
Functions are reusable blocks of code that perform a specific task. They help in organising code, making it modular, and avoiding repetition. Defining a function in Python is straightforward using the def keyword, followed by the function name and parentheses.

**Reserved keywords**
Reserved keywords are special words that are part of the Python language syntax and have specific meanings. They cannot be used as identifiers such as variable names, function names, or any other user-defined item.
