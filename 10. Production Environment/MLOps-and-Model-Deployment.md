# MLOps and Model Deployment 18/09/2025

# What is MLOps? A practical introduction

Machine Learning Operations - or MLOps - is the discipline that manages the full lifecycle of machine learning models in production. If machine learning models are the engines of intelligent systems, then MLOps is everything that ensures they’re built, tested, deployed, monitored, updated, and governed properly - not just once, but continuously.

1. Version control for data, code, and models
2. Automated testing and deployment pipelines
3. Monitoring for model performance and data drift
4. Collaboration between data science, engineering, and operations

## Understanding MLOPs

To understand MLOps, it helps to know where it came from:

- **DevOps** was created to bridge the gap between software development and IT operations. It introduced CI/CD pipelines, automated testing, and infrastructure as code - all to make software delivery faster and more reliable.
- **DataOps** emerged to solve problems in data pipeline development - improving the quality, governance, and delivery of data for analytics.

But machine learning systems are different. They combine:

- **Software code** (model logic and application code)
- **Training data** (which changes over time)
- **Model artifacts** (which need packaging and serving)
- **Runtime infrastructure** (which must scale reliably)

This makes ML systems more fragile and unpredictable than traditional software.

## The building blocks of MLOps

MLOps isn’t a single tool or process. It’s a collection of practices and components that work together. These typically include:

1. **Model Tracking:** Logging every model version, training dataset, configuration, and performance metric.
2. **Model Registry:** A central system for storing and managing model artifacts, often linked to Git and data sources.
3. **CI/CD Pipelines:** Automation for training, testing, and deploying models - reducing manual errors and speeding up delivery.
4. **Monitoring and Observability:** Real-time visibility into how a model is performing in production: accuracy, latency, and data drift.
5. **Collaboration and Handover:** Clear ownership and documentation between data science and engineering teams, avoiding the "throw-it-over-the-wall" problem.

### Without MLOps, organisations often encounter:

- **Unreliable models** that break in production environments
- **Inconsistent environments** between dev and prod
- **No rollback plan** if a model starts underperforming
- **Lack of auditability**, making it hard to explain decisions to regulators or business leaders

### MLOps solves this by:

- **Enforcing reproducibility:** Same model, same data, same results.
- **Enabling continuous improvement:** Automate retraining and redeployment.
- **Ensuring compliance and governance:** Track every decision and configuration.
- **Supporting real-world reliability:** Models that don’t just work, but keep working.

## MLOps vs Traditional ML

| **Area**          | **Traditional ML Workflow** | **MLOps Approach**                      |
|--------------------|-----------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Model development | Manual experimentation      | Version-controlled, tracked              |
| Deployment        | Manual, ad-hoc              | Automated CI/CD pipelines                |
| Monitoring        | Often ignored               | Active monitoring + alerting             |
| Collaboration     | Siloed teams                | Cross-functional integration             |
| Model updates     | Rare, painful               | Continuous retraining + rollback         |

# Automating the machine learning lifecycle

## Model Registry 

A model registry acts as a central hub where machine learning models are versioned, stored, and managed. It brings structure and control to model lifecycle management by clearly documenting which versions of a model are approved for production, which are under review, and which have been deprecated. Imagine a model registry as a digital warehouse. Each model stored inside has a label describing how it was trained, what data it used, and whether it's ready for deployment. When something goes wrong in production, engineers can quickly check the registry, identify the active version, and - if needed - roll back to a previous version that’s known to be stable. The registry becomes especially powerful in collaborative environments. It allows data scientists, ML engineers, and platform teams to share responsibility for models while maintaining visibility and control over their use.

## Tools that support automation: MLflow and Kubeflow

Two popular tools that help bring automation to the ML lifecycle are **MLflow** and **Kubeflow**. MLflow is lightweight and easy to integrate into Python-based workflows, making it a popular choice for small to mid-sized teams. It provides experiment tracking, model packaging, and registry features in a modular setup that works well across different environments. Kubeflow, on the other hand, is built for teams already using Kubernetes. It allows for scalable, production-grade machine learning workflows and supports complex orchestration of tasks like distributed training, hyperparameter tuning, and multi-step pipelines. It’s more infrastructure-heavy but offers excellent flexibility for organisations operating in cloud-native environments.
