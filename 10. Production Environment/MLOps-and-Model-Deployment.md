# MLOps and Model Deployment 18/09/2025

# What is MLOps? A practical introduction

Machine Learning Operations - or MLOps - is the discipline that manages the full lifecycle of machine learning models in production. If machine learning models are the engines of intelligent systems, then MLOps is everything that ensures they’re built, tested, deployed, monitored, updated, and governed properly - not just once, but continuously.

1. Version control for data, code, and models
2. Automated testing and deployment pipelines
3. Monitoring for model performance and data drift
4. Collaboration between data science, engineering, and operations

## Understanding MLOPs

To understand MLOps, it helps to know where it came from:

- **DevOps** was created to bridge the gap between software development and IT operations. It introduced CI/CD pipelines, automated testing, and infrastructure as code - all to make software delivery faster and more reliable.
- **DataOps** emerged to solve problems in data pipeline development - improving the quality, governance, and delivery of data for analytics.

But machine learning systems are different. They combine:

- **Software code** (model logic and application code)
- **Training data** (which changes over time)
- **Model artifacts** (which need packaging and serving)
- **Runtime infrastructure** (which must scale reliably)

This makes ML systems more fragile and unpredictable than traditional software.

## The building blocks of MLOps

MLOps isn’t a single tool or process. It’s a collection of practices and components that work together. These typically include:

1. **Model Tracking:** Logging every model version, training dataset, configuration, and performance metric.
2. **Model Registry:** A central system for storing and managing model artifacts, often linked to Git and data sources.
3. **CI/CD Pipelines:** Automation for training, testing, and deploying models - reducing manual errors and speeding up delivery.
4. **Monitoring and Observability:** Real-time visibility into how a model is performing in production: accuracy, latency, and data drift.
5. **Collaboration and Handover:** Clear ownership and documentation between data science and engineering teams, avoiding the "throw-it-over-the-wall" problem.

### Without MLOps, organisations often encounter:

- **Unreliable models** that break in production environments
- **Inconsistent environments** between dev and prod
- **No rollback plan** if a model starts underperforming
- **Lack of auditability**, making it hard to explain decisions to regulators or business leaders

### MLOps solves this by:

- **Enforcing reproducibility:** Same model, same data, same results.
- **Enabling continuous improvement:** Automate retraining and redeployment.
- **Ensuring compliance and governance:** Track every decision and configuration.
- **Supporting real-world reliability:** Models that don’t just work, but keep working.

## MLOps vs Traditional ML

| **Area**          | **Traditional ML Workflow** | **MLOps Approach**                      |
|--------------------|-----------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Model development | Manual experimentation      | Version-controlled, tracked              |
| Deployment        | Manual, ad-hoc              | Automated CI/CD pipelines                |
| Monitoring        | Often ignored               | Active monitoring + alerting             |
| Collaboration     | Siloed teams                | Cross-functional integration             |
| Model updates     | Rare, painful               | Continuous retraining + rollback         |
