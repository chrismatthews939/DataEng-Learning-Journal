## Cloud Computing History

Started from grid computing, which is solving problems with multiple machines connected as a grid.

The benefits are users can use cloud as a service rather than owning everything themselves and the grid element keeps everything going if one element brakes.

## Introduction to Cloud Computing

### What is Cloud Computing?
Cloud computing is the delivery of computing services—such as storage, processing power, databases, networking, and software—over the internet (the "cloud") instead of using local servers or personal computers.

#### Simple Analogy
Think of cloud computing like renting a car versus buying one:
- **On-Premises (Traditional IT):** You buy a car, maintain it, pay for repairs, and use it whenever needed.
- **Cloud Computing:** You rent a car when required, paying only for the duration you use it. No maintenance, no repairs, just pay-as-you-go.

### A Brief History of Cloud Computing
- **1960s:** Concept of time-sharing on mainframe computers.
- **1990s:** Internet boom led to the rise of web-based applications.
- **2000s:** Amazon Web Services (AWS) launched in 2006, kickstarting modern cloud computing.
- **2010s-Present:** Growth of cloud providers like Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud, and advancements in AI, machine learning, and scalable infrastructure.

### Major Cloud Providers
The cloud computing market is dominated by a few key players:
1. **Amazon Web Services (AWS)** – The leader in cloud services.
2. **Microsoft Azure** – Strong in enterprise and hybrid cloud solutions.
3. **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)** – Known for AI and data analytics.
4. **IBM Cloud** – Focuses on AI and enterprise services.
5. **Oracle Cloud** – Strong in databases and business applications.
6. **Alibaba Cloud** – A leading provider in Asia.

### How Cloud Computing Works
Cloud computing works by offering computing resources over the internet. These resources are housed in massive data centers owned by cloud providers. Users can access these services remotely without needing to buy or maintain physical hardware.

## Key Cloud Services
Cloud computing offers various services, generally categorized into three main types:

### 1. **Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)**
- Provides virtualized computing resources like servers, storage, and networking.
- Example: AWS EC2 (virtual machines), Google Compute Engine.

### 2. **Platform as a Service (PaaS)**
- Provides a development environment with tools for building, testing, and deploying applications.
- Example: Microsoft Azure App Services, Google App Engine.

### 3. **Software as a Service (SaaS)**
- Provides fully functional software applications over the internet.
- Example: Google Drive, Dropbox, Microsoft 365.

## Benefits of Cloud Computing
- **Scalability:** Easily scale resources up or down based on demand.
- **Cost-Effective:** Pay only for what you use; no upfront investment in hardware.
- **Reliability:** High availability and disaster recovery solutions.
- **Security:** Advanced security measures implemented by cloud providers.
- **Flexibility:** Access services from anywhere with an internet connection.

Cloud services are **elastic** meaning they scale up and down

## Conclusion
Cloud computing has revolutionized how businesses and individuals access technology. Instead of investing in costly hardware, companies can leverage the cloud to scale efficiently, reduce costs, and focus on innovation.
