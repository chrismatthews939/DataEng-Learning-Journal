# Project Report and Presentation

1. **Project Evaluation Report** is a written document where you explain your project from start to finish. It must cover the why, what, how, and impact of your work.
2. The **Presentation** is a short, structured talk (often 10 – 15 minutes) where you summarise key aspects of the project.
3. The **Q&A** gives assessors a chance to probe your reasoning, decisions, and reflections.

## Essential components include the following:

- **Executive summary:** clear and concise overview.
- **Objectives & scope:** what the project aimed to achieve.
- **Methodology:** technical approach, tools, and frameworks used.
- **Implementation:** description of the build or pipeline.
- **Results:** outcomes and measurements.
- **Evaluation:** strengths, weaknesses, improvements.
- **Reflection:** what you learned, professional growth, links to KSBs.

## The anatomy of a strong presentation

A strong presentation doesn’t just share information - it tells a compelling story.

This section outlines the key ingredients of an effective presentation, helping you structure your message clearly, use visuals wisely, and leave a lasting impression on your audience.

Essential components include the following:

- **Keep slides simple:** use visuals, diagrams, and bullet points sparingly.
- **Follow a clear flow:** Introduction → Problem → Solution → Results → Reflection.
- **Use slides to support your message**, not to read from.
- **Finish with a strong conclusion:** why this project mattered.

## Handling the questions

Answering questions confidently is a key part of any assessment.

This section prepares you for the types of questions assessors may ask - testing your understanding, decision-making, and ability to reflect - and offers practical strategies to respond effectively and link back to your evidence.

### Top tips include the following:

Expect assessors to test: your understanding, decision - making, and ability to reflect.

Common question types:

- **Clarification:** “Why did you choose this method?”
- **Justification:** “What alternatives did you consider?”
- **Reflection:** “What would you do differently?”
- **Strategy:** Use STAR (Situation, Task, Action, Result) or simply answer directly and link back to your evidence.

# Lecture 

## Choosing a project

- Clear scope
- Real data challenge
- demonstrates KSBs
- Business relevant

### KSBs and themes to hit are here. (EPA tab - Project evaluation section)

https://skillsengland.education.gov.uk/apprenticeship-standards/st1386

- Does my project involve multiple souces or formats
- Can it be explained easily
- Will it evidence KSBs
- Will it produce measurable outcomes

## Report Structure

3,500 words

- Executive summary
- Objectives and scope
- methodology
- Implementation
- Results
- Evaluation
- Reflection

## Writing

- Too vague ("it worked well")
- Too technical (hard to follow)
- Too long winded (buried evidence)

1. **Clarity** - plain English, short sentences
2. **Conciseness** - say more with less
3. **Evidence** - include metrics and outcomes. Someone said it was better
4. **Reflection** - show how I've improved whilst being on the course. **Use the KSBs** aand rewrite them


### Bad example

`I used SQL and Python to do some transformations. This helped me clean the data, and I think it worked well. The project used good tools and I was happy with the result.`


### Good example

`I standardised source formatting, enriched NULL values and removed duplicates. As a result the data passed our quality control benchmarks and stakeholder bug tickets have dropped by 80%. From this I showed my progress in dealing with data quality issues such as completeness and standardising the ETL process for cleaner data`

"From this ..." is directly from the KSB list

Can leave them in and delete before submitting so I can track the ones included 

`From this I showed my progress in dealing with data quality issues such as completeness (K4) and standardising the ETL process for cleaner data (S6) `

## Presentation

- Summerise, don't duplicate
- Show confidence and clarity
- Communicate professionally

### Slide Design Tips

- Simple is stronger
- Show confidence and clarity
- Communicate professionally
- Avoid big paragraphs
- Visuals better than text
- **Mutually Exclusive / Content Exhaustive (MECE)** 

### Structure

1. Introduction
2. Problem/Context
3. Solution/Approach
4. Results
5. Reflection
6. Conclusion

## Notes

EPA

Once you're in Gateway it's up to me 
13 weeks - 
Professional discussion - 10 questions - learn about scaling etc and things I don't do
2 on each theme (Portfolio pieces)
Pipeline is one I can use for my project

10 weeks to write report
last three weeks is interview

Module 9 is basically project

27th December go into Gateway

All KSBs demonstrated in one project

https://skillsengland.education.gov.uk/apprenticeship-standards/st1386-v1-0

In EPA tab it has the report structure

I can use stuff from my portfolio exercises as these are not send to the assessors

For a professional document (750 words) explaining how someone might demonstrate regulatory compliance in a data stewarding role give some industry best practice examples of security standards, ethics and procedures, actions and outcomes and governance applied
