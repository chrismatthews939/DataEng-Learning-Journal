# Project Report and Presentation

1. **Project Evaluation Report** is a written document where you explain your project from start to finish. It must cover the why, what, how, and impact of your work.
2. The **Presentation** is a short, structured talk (often 10 – 15 minutes) where you summarise key aspects of the project.
3. The **Q&A** gives assessors a chance to probe your reasoning, decisions, and reflections.

## Essential components include the following:

- **Executive summary:** clear and concise overview.
- **Objectives & scope:** what the project aimed to achieve.
- **Methodology:** technical approach, tools, and frameworks used.
- **Implementation:** description of the build or pipeline.
- **Results:** outcomes and measurements.
- **Evaluation:** strengths, weaknesses, improvements.
- **Reflection:** what you learned, professional growth, links to KSBs.
