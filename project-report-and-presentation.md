# Project Report and Presentation

1. **Project Evaluation Report** is a written document where you explain your project from start to finish. It must cover the why, what, how, and impact of your work.
2. The **Presentation** is a short, structured talk (often 10 – 15 minutes) where you summarise key aspects of the project.
3. The **Q&A** gives assessors a chance to probe your reasoning, decisions, and reflections.

## Essential components include the following:

- **Executive summary:** clear and concise overview.
- **Objectives & scope:** what the project aimed to achieve.
- **Methodology:** technical approach, tools, and frameworks used.
- **Implementation:** description of the build or pipeline.
- **Results:** outcomes and measurements.
- **Evaluation:** strengths, weaknesses, improvements.
- **Reflection:** what you learned, professional growth, links to KSBs.

## The anatomy of a strong presentation

A strong presentation doesn’t just share information - it tells a compelling story.

This section outlines the key ingredients of an effective presentation, helping you structure your message clearly, use visuals wisely, and leave a lasting impression on your audience.

Essential components include the following:

- **Keep slides simple:** use visuals, diagrams, and bullet points sparingly.
- **Follow a clear flow:** Introduction → Problem → Solution → Results → Reflection.
- **Use slides to support your message**, not to read from.
- **Finish with a strong conclusion:** why this project mattered.

## Handling the questions

Answering questions confidently is a key part of any assessment.

This section prepares you for the types of questions assessors may ask - testing your understanding, decision-making, and ability to reflect - and offers practical strategies to respond effectively and link back to your evidence.

### Top tips include the following:

Expect assessors to test: your understanding, decision - making, and ability to reflect.

Common question types:

- **Clarification:** “Why did you choose this method?”
- **Justification:** “What alternatives did you consider?”
- **Reflection:** “What would you do differently?”
- **Strategy:** Use STAR (Situation, Task, Action, Result) or simply answer directly and link back to your evidence.

# Lecture 

## Choosing a project

- Clear scope
- Real data challenge
- demonstrates KSBs
- Business relevant

### KSBs and themes to hit are here. (EPA tab - Project evaluation section)

https://skillsengland.education.gov.uk/apprenticeship-standards/st1386

- Does my project involve multiple souces or formats
- Can it be explained easily
- Will it evidence KSBs
- Will it produce measurable outcomes

## Report Structure

3,500 words

- Executive summary
- Objectives and scope
- methodology
- Implementation
- Results
- Evaluation
- Reflection

## Writing

- Too vague ("it worked well")
- Too technical (hard to follow)
- Too long winded (buried evidence)

1. **Clarity** - plain English, short sentences
2. **Conciseness** - say more with less
3. **Evidence** - include metrics and outcomes. Someone said it was better
4. **Reflection** - show how I've improved whilst being on the course. **Use the KSBs** aand rewrite them


### Bad example

`I used SQL and Python to do some transformations. This helped me clean the data, and I think it worked well. The project used good tools and I was happy with the result.`


### Good example

`I standardised source formatting, enriched NULL values and removed duplicates. As a result the data passed our quality control benchmarks and stakeholder bug tickets have dropped by 80%. From this I showed my progress in dealing with data quality issues such as completeness and standardising the ETL process for cleaner data`

"From this ..." is directly from the KSB list

Can leave them in and delete before submitting so I can track the ones included 

`From this I showed my progress in dealing with data quality issues such as completeness (K4) and standardising the ETL process for cleaner data (S6) `

## Presentation

- Summerise, don't duplicate
- Show confidence and clarity
- Communicate professionally

### Slide Design Tips

- Simple is stronger
- Show confidence and clarity
- Communicate professionally
- Avoid big paragraphs
- Visuals better than text
- **Mutually Exclusive / Content Exhaustive (MECE)** 

### Structure

1. Introduction
2. Problem/Context
3. Solution/Approach
4. Results
5. Reflection
6. Conclusion

## Notes

EPA

Once you're in Gateway it's up to me 
13 weeks - 
Professional discussion - 10 questions - learn about scaling etc and things I don't do
2 on each theme (Portfolio pieces)
Pipeline is one I can use for my project

10 weeks to write report
last three weeks is interview

Module 9 is basically project

27th December go into Gateway

All KSBs demonstrated in one project

https://skillsengland.education.gov.uk/apprenticeship-standards/st1386-v1-0

In EPA tab it has the report structure

I can use stuff from my portfolio exercises as these are not send to the assessors

For a professional document (750 words) explaining how someone might demonstrate regulatory compliance in a data stewarding role give some industry best practice examples of security standards, ethics and procedures, actions and outcomes and governance applied

# CDP Delivery for EPA Project Report

CDP Project is current and covers the below 

a specific problem
a recurring issue
an idea or opportunity

an executive summary (or abstract)
an introduction
the scope of the project (including key performance indicators, aims and objectives)
a project plan
research outcomes
data product outcomes
project outcomes
discussion of findings
recommendations and conclusions
references
appendix containing mapping of KSBs to the report.






# CDP Presentation 

20mins and will have 30mins of questions

The presentation should cover:

an overview of the project
the project scope (including key performance indicators)
summary of actions undertaken by the apprentice
project outcomes and how these were achieved
The presentation with questions must last 50 minutes. This will typically include a presentation of 20 minutes and questioning lasting 30 minutes. The independent assessor must use the full time available for questioning. The independent assessor can increase the time of the presentation and questioning by up to 10%. This time is to allow the apprentice to complete their last point or respond to a question if necessary.

The independent assessor must ask at least 6 questions. They must use the questions from the EPAO’s question bank or create their own questions in line with the EPAO’s training. Follow up questions are allowed where clarification is required.

The purpose of the independent assessor's questions is:

to verify that the activity was completed by the apprentice
to seek clarification where required
to assess those KSBs that the apprentice did not have the opportunity to demonstrate with the report, although these should be kept to a minimum
to assess level of competence against the grading descriptors
The apprentice must submit any presentation materials to the EPAO at the same time as the report - by the end of week 10 of the EPA period. The apprentice must notify the EPAO, at that point, of any technical requirements for the presentation.

During the presentation, the apprentice must have access to:

audio-visual presentation equipment
flip chart and writing and drawing materials
computer
The independent assessor must have at least 2 weeks to review the project report and any presentation materials, to allow them to prepare questions.

The apprentice must be given at least 2 weeks’ notice of the presentation with questions.



# Questions

The EPAO will ask ten questions, two for each of the themes:

Data quality and performance
Problem solving
Regulatory Compliance
Continuous Improvement
Continuous professional development - easy points if i have a good answer from portfolio 5
