# Topic 1 - Fundamentals of the Data-Driven Enterprise - 28/09/2024

## Objectives
- Data Driven Culture
- Fundamentals of Data
- Engineering best Practices
- Data Types

## Key Concepts
### Building a Data Driven Culture
- Data driven culture is one where decisions are based on facts rather than guesswork, authority, legacy etc.
- Five V's Framework describles the attributes of a good data landscape:
  - volume (amount)
  - variety (structured/unstructured)
  - velocity (speed it's generated and processed)
  - veracity (reliabilty and accuracy)
  - value (insights generated from it)
### Data Types
- Qualitive (Not numbers)
  - Bionominal. 1/0, True/False
  - Nominal. Catagories, Red, Yellow, Green
  - Ordinal. In an order. Poor, Medium, Good
- Quantitative (numbers)
  - Discreet. Counted values. No of people
  - Continuous. Measured. Height, Distance
### Identifying Standards and Best Practice
![API standards](https://learn.bpp.com/pluginfile.php/1253474/mod_scorm/content/2/scormcontent/assets/Rest-API.png)
- Restful API principals. This term refers to the client-server architecture for designing networked applications, promoting statelessness and resource-based URLs for efficient data manipulation.
- OpenAPI. This term refers to the standard specification for building and documenting RESTful APIs, accelerating development cycles and enhancing collaboration.
- AWS Cloud framework. Many web applications, including social media platforms and e-commerce websites, rely on JSON for seamless communication.
- Azure Cloud Framework. Financial institutions often use CSV files for data integration and analysis.
- Regulatory requirements
  - GDPR is an EU regulation governing data privacy and consent, impacting European government agencies' data handling processes
  - ISO 27001. ISO 27001 is an international standard that provides guidelines and best practices for establishing, implementing, maintaining, and continuously improving an Information Security Management System (ISMS). In the context of data engineering, adhering to ISO 27001 regulations is crucial for ensuring the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data and information assets
- Data Stewardship. Responsible for:
  - Data governance
  - Data quality
  - Data ethics
- Data Engineering best practices:
    - Scalability
    - Reliability
    - Security
    - Performance
    - Documentation
### Data Types
![Used google collab for coding practice](https://colab.research.google.com/)
- JSON. Lightweight. Best for web apps
- CSV. Tabular. Best for Finance
- XML. Markup language. Best for exchanging data between systems

- Pandas. Library for working with structures data in python. Puts data in dataframes for performance. Basically python SQL with more functionaility
- Python. Programming language. Easy to read, good for ML and stats
  
## Topic 1 Reflections
- Transitioning to a data driven culture requires both technical and cultureal shifts.
- I'll aim to introduce this into my team by reinforcing the benefits of evidence based decision making.
- I'll also aim to adhere to the engineering best practices listed above.
