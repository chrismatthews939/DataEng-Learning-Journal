# Topic 4 - Introduction to reliable data architectures - 17/10/2024

## Objectives
1. Design reliable and compliant data architectures by employing visual modelling and diagramming techniques
2. Mitigate fundamental data risks within architectures
3. Develop strategies for effective metadata management
   
## Key Concepts
Three main types of design in data engineering:
1. Unified modelling language (UML) diagrams
2. Entity-relationship diagrams (ERDs)
3.Architecture diagrams (e.g. Layered architecture, microservices architecture) 

## Unified modelling language (UML) diagrams
### Use Case Diagrams
A use case diagram is a diagram that provides a visual representation of how users interact with a system. It illustrates the various interactions between users (actors) and the system to accomplish specific tasks or goals. 

Use case diagrams play a crucial role in system analysis and design by providing a visual representation of user-system interactions, aiding in communication between stakeholders, and guiding the development process towards building a system that fulfils user requirements effectively.

### Use Case Diagram Best Practice
- Using standardised notation and symbols
- Clearly depicting data flow and transformations
- Highlighting dependencies and relationships
- Maintaining clarity and readability

## EDRs
An entity relationship diagram (ERD) serves as a powerful visualisation tool for understanding the relationships between different entities within an application or database.

### Logical Diagrams
Logical diagrams are designed to illustrate the high-level flow of data within our system without referencing any specific vendors.

### Solution Diagram
A solution diagram provides a more detailed representation of our system architecture, including specific vendor solutions or platforms.
It highlights the exact systems and technologies involved at each stage of data processing, offering a more concrete view of our solution landscape.
