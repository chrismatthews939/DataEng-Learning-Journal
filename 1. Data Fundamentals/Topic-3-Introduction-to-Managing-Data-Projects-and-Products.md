# Topic 3 - Introduction to Managing Data Projects and Products - 10/10/2024

## Objectives
- List the limitations of the Waterfall model in the context of data science projects
- Explain how Agile principles and frameworks can foster adaptability and collaboration
- Identify which Lean and SixSigma practices can drive continuous improvement
- Evaluate approaches to collaborating with diverse stakeholders in a way that aligns data-driven initiatives with business objectives
- Argue how a data-driven culture can be championed within your organisation by leveraging the synergies between Agile, Lean and SixSigma approaches

## Key Concepts
Most popular methodologies are Waterfall and Agile.

## Agile
More modern approach. Work in sprints. Best when trends change fast. Spotify is a good example because music trends change fast.

Stages:
- Plan
- Design
- Launch
- Develop
- Test
- Deploy
- Review

Benefits of Agile:
- Nible approach
- Flexible and adaptable
- Great for volitile environments
  
Drawbacks of Agile:
- Demands constant communication
- Costs are unpredicable 

## Waterfall
More traditional linear approach. Best for when requirements are very clear and non flexible. Think of NASA they can't afford to change things the goal is very clear.

Stages:
- Plan
- Design
- Build
- Test
- Maintain

Benefits of Waterfall:
- Predicable
- Easier to manage
  
Drawbacks of Waterfall:
- Lacks the flexibility to repond to changes
- Not ideal for fast moving markets

Key Message:
There's no one-size-fits-all in software development methodologies. Agile is for maximising the business value, especially the value for users. Waterfall is for optimising the balance of constraints, that is, the management of scope, time, and cost constraints in a project. 

Two very different approaches for two very different uses. Applying one for every type of project simply doesnâ€™t work.

Example Failure of Waterfall:
A notable example of Waterfall failing is the NHS IT project in 2002. Despite being planned using Waterfall and gathering requirements the project overran and even with a budget of 6mil it cost over 12bil and many objectives not achieved. The NHS was too compicated for a Waterfall model. Often large scale software projects don't do well with this approach.

The Waterfall model proved to be unsuitable for the NPfIT project due to inadequate understanding of user needs and changing requirements over time. Doctors lacked trust as they were not involved in feedback loops, while admin users resisted centralised decision-making.

How Agile could have helped:
Agile could have improved end user engagement, phased change management, and project scalability by breaking down the NPfIT mega-project into agile sub-projects.
Agile's flexibility and iterative approach would have allowed for ongoing adjustments based on feedback and evolving requirements, making it more suitable for the scenario.

Specific limitiation of Waterfall in Data Science:
- Difficulty accomodating change. When working on data projects, we often learn from the data, especially when exploring unstructured data. This means that our business and user requirements may change over time.
- Lengthy development cycles. The sequential nature of Waterfall can result in lengthy development cycles, failing to keep pace with rapidly changing market conditions and user needs.
- Lack of stakeholder feedback. The Waterfall model limits the ability to obtain timely feedback from stakeholders and end-users, increasing the risk of delivering a solution that no longer meets their needs.
- Challenges with data complexity. Data engineering projects, with their complex data sources and quality issues, pose challenges that the Waterfall model struggles to address due to its lack of flexibility and space for experimentation, limiting opportunities for learning and optimisation.

## Topic 3 Reflections
Learning about different approaches I can understand why we use Agile in BT. Both the business strategy and stakeholder demand on specific projects is fast changing and Agile helps us readjust to continue delivering at pace.
