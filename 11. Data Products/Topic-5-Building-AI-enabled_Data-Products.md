## 1. Artificial Intelligence (AI) vs. Machine Learning (ML)

**Artificial Intelligence (AI):**  
A broad field of computer science that enables machines to simulate human intelligence, including reasoning, problem-solving, and decision-making.

**Machine Learning (ML):**  
A subset of AI focused on algorithms that learn from data and improve performance without explicit programming (Reis & Housley, 2022).

### Comparison Table

| Concept | Definition | Example |
|--------|------------|---------|
| **AI** | The simulation of human intelligence in machines | Chatbots that understand and respond to customer queries |
| **ML** | Algorithms that improve with experience | A fraud detection system that learns from transaction patterns |

---

## 2. Types of Machine Learning

- **Supervised Learning:** Learns from labelled data (e.g., spam detection in emails).  
- **Unsupervised Learning:** Finds patterns in unlabelled data (e.g., customer segmentation).  
- **Reinforcement Learning:** Learns through trial and error (e.g., AI improving at video games).

**Example:**  
A retail company uses supervised learning to predict future sales based on historical purchase data, improving inventory management.

---

## 3. The Difference Between AI and ML

AI and ML are often used interchangeably, but they are distinct.  
AI is the broader concept of enabling machines to perform tasks requiring human intelligence, while ML is a subset focused specifically on learning from data to make predictions and improve over time.

---

### AI vs. ML: Understanding the Relationship

| Concept | Definition | Example |
|---------|------------|---------|
| **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** | Simulates human intelligence for reasoning, problem-solving, and decision-making | A virtual assistant like Alexa interpreting voice commands |
| **Machine Learning (ML)** | Trains models using data so systems improve without explicit programming | A fraud detection system improving accuracy over time |

---

### Similarities Between AI and ML

| Aspect | Artificial Intelligence (AI) | Machine Learning (ML) |
|--------|------------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Automation** | Automates decision-making and problem-solving | Automates learning from data to improve decisions |
| **Data-Driven** | Uses data for human-like intelligence | Learns patterns from data for predictions |
| **Goal** | Improve efficiency, accuracy, and automation | Improves performance by training models |

---

### Differences Between AI and ML
