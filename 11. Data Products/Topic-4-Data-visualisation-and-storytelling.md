# Principles of Effective Data Visualisation

Effective data visualisation transforms raw data into clear, meaningful insights that support decision-making. Poorly designed visuals can lead to misinterpretation, confusion, or lost insights. To create effective visualisations, designers must focus on clarity, accuracy, accessibility, and engagement (Few, 2012).

# Key Principles of Data Visualisation

## Choosing the Right Chart Type
- **Line charts** show trends over time.  
- **Bar charts** compare categories.  
- **Scatter plots** display relationships between variables.  
- **Heatmaps** reveal patterns in large datasets (Cairo, 2013).

**Example:**  
A retail business comparing monthly sales across different stores should use a **bar chart** for easy comparison rather than a table of numbers.

## Use of Colour and Contrast
- Use colour strategically to highlight important trends.  
- Avoid using too many colours, which can cause confusion (Tufte, 2001).  
- Ensure sufficient contrast for accessibility, particularly for colour-blind users.

**Example:**  
A climate change dashboard might use a **gradient colour scale** to show temperature changes over time, making patterns easier to spot.

## Accessibility and Inclusivity
- Ensure text is legible and font sizes are appropriate.  
- Use alternative text and tooltips for screen reader users.  
- Follow **Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)** for designing accessible charts (Reis & Housley, 2022).

**Example:**  
A government agency’s unemployment report should use **high-contrast colour schemes** and provide **alternative text descriptions** to ensure accessibility for all users.

## Simplicity and Clarity
- Avoid unnecessary complexity by reducing clutter (Few, 2012).  
- Use clear labels, legends, and annotations to guide interpretation.  
- Remove *chartjunk* (e.g., excessive colours, 3D effects) that distracts from key insights.

**Example:**  
A financial dashboard displaying profit trends over time should use a **simple line chart** rather than an overcrowded **3D pie chart** that may distort proportions (McCandless, 2019).
