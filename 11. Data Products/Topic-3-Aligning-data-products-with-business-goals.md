# Translating business objectives into data product features

`A well-designed data product must align with business objectives to provide meaningful insights, enhance efficiency, and support decision-making. Translating business goals into data product features requires understanding user needs, defining key use cases, and ensuring that technical implementation supports strategic priorities (Reis & Housley, 2022).`

### Identify Core Business Goals

- Define what the organisation wants to achieve (e.g., increasing customer retention, improving operational efficiency, enhancing security).
- Determine how data-driven insights can support these goals.

### Map Business Goals to Data Product Features

- Convert objectives into actionable data features, such as real-time analytics, recommendation engines, or automated reporting.
- Ensure that features directly address pain points and opportunities identified in the business strategy.

### Validate Features with Stakeholders

- Engage business leaders, product owners, and end-users to refine feature requirements.
- Use agile development to test and iterate based on feedback.

# Aligning data products with organisational goals

For a data product to be effective, it must align with an organisation’s strategic objectives. A misalignment between data capabilities and business needs can result in underutilised tools, inefficient workflows, and missed opportunities. Ensuring that data products support organisational goals requires stakeholder collaboration, clear performance metrics, and adaptability to evolving business priorities (Davenport, 2020).

## Identifying Business Priorities

- Understand the organisation’s short-term and long-term objectives.  
- Identify key areas where data-driven insights can improve decision-making, efficiency, or customer experience.  
- Ensure alignment with industry trends and competitive strategies.  

**Example:**  
*A healthcare provider aiming to improve patient outcomes may prioritise a predictive analytics model that identifies high-risk patients early, reducing hospital readmissions.*

---

## Engaging Key Stakeholders

- Convert objectives into actionable data features, such as real-time analytics, recommendation engines, or automated reporting.  
- Ensure that features directly address pain points and opportunities identified in the business strategy.  

**Example:**  
*A retail company developing a customer segmentation dashboard engaged marketing, sales, and data teams to ensure the tool provided actionable insights for personalised marketing campaigns.*

---

## Defining Measurable Success Metrics

- Establish key performance indicators (KPIs) to track the effectiveness of the data product.  
- Align metrics with business outcomes such as revenue growth, operational efficiency, customer retention, or compliance adherence.  

**Example:**  
*A financial institution implementing an AI-powered fraud detection system measured success by reducing false positives by 30% and improving fraud detection rates.*

---

## Ensuring Scalability and Future-Proofing

- Design data products to adapt to changing business needs and market conditions.  
- Use modular architectures, API integrations, and cloud-based solutions to support scalability.  

**Example:**  
*A logistics company designed a real-time shipment tracking system with cloud-based analytics, ensuring scalability as the business expanded internationally.*

# Prioritising features based on business impact

Developing a data product involves balancing business goals, user needs, and technical feasibility. Not all requested features can or should be implemented at once. Prioritisation ensures that the most impactful features—those that drive efficiency, revenue growth, compliance, or customer satisfaction—are delivered first. Effective prioritisation involves weighing business impact, feasibility, and user demand to guide development decisions (Davenport, 2020).

# 1. Business Value vs. Effort Matrix

A common approach to feature prioritisation is using a **Business Value vs. Effort Matrix**, which helps teams categorise features based on their potential impact and the effort required to implement them.

## Categories

| Category              | Definition                                      | Example Feature                                                   |
|------------------------|------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Quick Wins**         | High business impact, low effort               | Adding real-time filters to a sales dashboard                     |
| **Strategic Investments** | High business impact, high effort              | Implementing a machine learning fraud detection model             |
| **Low-Priority Features** | Low business impact, low effort                | Adding cosmetic User Interface (UI) changes                       |
| **Avoid**              | Low business impact, high effort               | Building a custom reporting tool when third-party integrations exist |

Effective prioritisation involves weighing business impact, feasibility, and user demand to guide development decisions (Davenport, 2020).

# Key Approaches to Feature Prioritisation

Effective feature prioritisation is crucial for developing data products that deliver maximum business value. By using structured approaches like the **Business Value vs. Effort Matrix**, **MoSCoW Prioritisation Framework**, and **Weighted Scoring Model**, organisations can systematically evaluate and prioritise features based on their impact, feasibility, and alignment with strategic goals.

## 1. Business Value vs. Effort Matrix

A common approach to feature prioritisation is using a **Business Value vs. Effort Matrix**, which helps teams categorise features based on their potential impact and the effort required to implement them.

| **Category**            | **Definition**                                | **Example Feature**                                           |
|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Quick Wins**           | High business impact, low effort              | Adding real-time filters to a sales dashboard                 |
| **Strategic Investments**| High business impact, high effort             | Implementing a machine learning fraud detection model          |
| **Low-Priority Features**| Low business impact, low effort               | Adding cosmetic User Interface (UI) changes                   |
| **Avoid**                | Low business impact, high effort              | Building a custom reporting tool when third-party integrations exist |

**Example Scenario:**  
A financial services company identified real-time fraud alerts as a *quick win* with high impact and low effort, while developing AI-driven credit risk modelling was classified as a *strategic investment* requiring more resources.

## 2. MoSCoW Prioritisation Framework

The **MoSCoW framework** categorises features into four priority levels:

- **Must-Have:** Essential for product viability (e.g., compliance reporting in a financial dashboard)  
- **Should-Have:** Important but not immediately critical (e.g., advanced data visualisation options)  
- **Could-Have:** Enhancements that add value but are not urgent (e.g., customisable colour themes)  
- **Won’t-Have:** Features deliberately excluded for now (e.g., voice search in a data warehouse)  

**Example Scenario:**  
A logistics company using the MoSCoW method determined that real-time shipment tracking was a *must-have*, while predictive delivery estimates were a *should-have* that could be implemented later.

## 3. Weighted Scoring Model

A **Weighted Scoring Model** assigns numerical values to features based on predefined criteria such as:

- **Business Impact (40%)** – How much does the feature contribute to key business goals?  
- **User Demand (30%)** – How many users require this feature?  
- **Technical Feasibility (20%)** – How complex is the implementation?  
- **Compliance & Security (10%)** – Does it meet regulatory requirements?  

| **Feature**                 | **Business Impact (40%)** | **User Demand (30%)** | **Feasibility (20%)** | **Compliance (10%)** | **Total Score** |
|-----------------------------|---------------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|----------------------|-----------------|
| Real-time fraud alerts      | 9                         | 8                     | 7                     | 9                    | **8.2**         |
| Custom report builder       | 5                         | 6                     | 9                     | 6                    | **6.3**         |
| Predictive demand forecasting | 10                        | 9                     | 5                     | 7                    | **8.1**         |
