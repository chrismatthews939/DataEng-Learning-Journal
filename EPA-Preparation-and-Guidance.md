# Key concepts and skills required for EPA

## What is the End-Point Assessment (EPA)?

The EPA is the final stage of the Level 5 Data Engineer apprenticeship. It’s your opportunity to demonstrate that you’ve developed the required Knowledge, Skills, and Behaviours (KSBs) to work independently and professionally as a Data Engineer. The EPA typically includes:

1. **A project presentation with Q&A**, where you showcase a significant piece of work you've contributed to

2. **A professional discussion** underpinned by a portfolio, where you reflect on your work and how it meets the required KSBs

`Your goal is to show not only that you’ve done the work, but that you understand why it mattered and can explain it clearly, with confidence and precision.`

Your project and discussion will draw heavily on core knowledge areas from the standard. These include (but are not limited to):

- **Data modelling and storage** - showing you understand how to design efficient schemas or use cloud storage appropriately.
- **Data integration and processing** - including how you design and implement pipelines that handle transformations, scheduling, or orchestration.
- **Security and compliance** - demonstrating how you handle sensitive data or apply access controls.
- **Quality and testing** - explaining how you ensure reliability, correctness, and repeatability in your work.

The EPA also assesses how well you apply your knowledge. These practical skills include (but are not limited to):

- Building and maintaining data pipelines
- Using programming languages and tooling effectively
- Collaborating with others, including business teams or senior engineers
- Troubleshooting and resolving incidents

## What does good evidence look like?

Good EPA evidence doesn’t come from one big project alone. It comes from well-chosen examples that demonstrate a range of skills across real contexts. For example:

- Talking about how you debugged and resolved a tricky pipeline issue
- Explaining the design choices you made for a data model and why
- Describing how you worked with stakeholders to define data quality rules

## Strategies for effective preparation and practice

Your first step is to get familiar with the **KSBs** (Knowledge, Skills and Behaviours). You don’t need to memorise them word-for-word - but you should understand the types of evidence they’re looking for. Print them out, highlight the ones you feel strong in, and circle the areas you want to improve or clarify with examples.

**Reflect on your work:** Building confidence and clarity through critical thinking in data engineering.

Reflection is one of your most powerful tools. Start asking yourself:

- What have I built, and why did it matter?
- What challenges did I face, and how did I overcome them?
- When did I take ownership or make improvements to an existing system?

You might know your projects inside out - but can you talk about them smoothly under pressure? Practise explaining a project to a friend or colleague who isn’t familiar with your technical stack. Record yourself and play it back. Where do you hesitate? Are you giving enough context, or jumping into jargon too quickly? 

Use the **STAR method (Situation, Task, Action, Result)** to structure your examples. It helps you stay focused and avoid wandering off-topic.

### Create a preparation routine

You don’t need to prepare for hours each day. Instead, build a light but consistent routine. For example:

Day 1: Review one knowledge area and write a short reflection
Day 2: Practise answering a behavioural question aloud
Day 3: Rehearse explaining one key project
Day 4: Watch a sample presentation or review assessor guidance
Day 5: Take a break

## Strong EPA Examples

“In my role, I designed and implemented a data validation layer using Python and Pandas. This process checked for null values, inconsistent date formats, and out-of-range values. After deployment, we saw a 40% reduction in downstream report errors.

I collaborated with a QA engineer to define these rules and iterated weekly based on feedback. Looking back, I would have added schema checks earlier to reduce our reliance on manual input.”

Why this works:

This learner shows technical skill, collaboration, impact, and self-awareness. They go beyond “what” they did and explain “how” and “why” with a professional tone.

### Best practices for telling your story

To improve your responses, focus on these habits:

1. **Be specific**. General phrases like “I helped with…” don’t show ownership. Describe your exact contribution.
2. **Give context**. What problem were you solving? Who was the user or stakeholder?
3. **Use data** if available. Even rough impact metrics help show value.
4. **Show learning**. If something didn’t go perfectly, that’s okay. What did you take away from it?
