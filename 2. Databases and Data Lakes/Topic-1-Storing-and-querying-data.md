### Data Marketplaces
Data marketplaces are online platforms where individuals and organisations can buy, sell, or exchange various types of data. These platforms serve as intermediaries, connecting data providers with data consumers, and facilitating transactions between them. Data marketplaces offer a wide range of datasets, including demographic data, consumer behavior data, financial data, and more. They play a crucial role in the data economy by enabling organisations to access additional data sources to enhance their analytics, decision-making, and innovation efforts.

Examples include:
- Kaggle (subsidiary of google)
- Data.world
- AWS Data Exchange

## Storing Files: HDFS, Key-Value Stores, Columnar â€“ Parquet Format, Filesystems

### Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS)
An introduction to Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) as a revolutionary technology between 2008-2016, which turned data centres into computing clusters by bringing computation to the data. 

This innovative approach allowed for cheap commodity storage, offering resilience by storing three copies of each file and distribution by ensuring each file resides on at least three different machines. This configuration not only provided a cost-effective solution for managing vast amounts of data but also enhanced data accessibility and analysis capabilities.

### Key-value stores
Key-value stores offer a straightforward yet efficient method for storing and retrieving data based on a unique key, tailoring their approach for scenarios where quick data access is critical.

Meanwhile, the Parquet format, designed for efficiency in analytic queries, employs a columnar storage strategy that significantly reduces disk I/O, facilitating faster data processing and enabling schema evolution with minimal overhead.

### Storage formats
This section discusses the trade-offs between using Hard Disk Drives (HDDs) and Solid-State Drives (SSDs) for data storage, touching on aspects of speed, durability, and cost. HDDs, with their mechanical parts, are generally more affordable but slower and more prone to failure compared to SSDs, which offer faster data access but at a higher price point. The Parquet format, by addressing the need for efficient data analytics through its columnar storage approach, enables organisations to conduct analytic queries more efficiently, leveraging schema evolution to adapt to changing data requirements without significant reengineering.

### Parquet
- Parquet files are columnar storage formats, meaning data is stored by column rather than by row. This structure allows for better compression and efficient storage, especially for large datasets with many columns.
- Parquet files are highly optimized for analytical queries, as they allow for selective column reads and efficient compression techniques. This results in faster data processing and reduced I/O overhead compared to CSV and JSON files.
- Parquet files offer advanced features such as schema evolution, predicate pushdown, and efficient encoding schemes. These features make Parquet ideal for data analytics and big data processing frameworks like Apache Spark and Apache Hive

### CSV
- CSV files are plain text files where each line represents a single row of data, and values are separated by commas or other delimiters.
- CSV files are simple and easy to read/write but may not be efficient for large datasets or analytical workloads due to their row-oriented structure.
- CSV files are widely supported and easy to work with in many programming languages and tools. However, they lack built-in support for nested data structures or data types.

### JSON
- JSON files support nested structures and are commonly used for representing semi-structured data. They are well-suited for web APIs and applications where flexibility is important.
- JSON files offer flexibility and support for complex data structures but can be less efficient in terms of storage and processing compared to more optimized formats.
- JSON files support nested structures and are commonly used for representing semi-structured data. They are well-suited for web APIs and applications where flexibility is important.

### Key-value pairs databases
Key-value stores, such as Redis and DynamoDB, provide a highly efficient mechanism for data retrieval using a simple key. They excel in scenarios requiring rapid access to data, such as session storage, user preferences, or caching. The simplicity of key-value stores allows for high-performance operations, making them an indispensable part of the technology stack where response time is critical. Their scalability and ease of use have made them a popular choice for web applications and microservices architectures, where they can quickly serve data to users and processes.
- Key-value databases are often used as a caching layer in front of a more persistent data store to improve the read performance of an application.
- Key-value databases can be used to store user session data, such as login status, shopping cart contents, or other temporary data.
- Key-value databases can be used to store and process large amounts of data in real -time, such as sensor data, social media feeds and IoT data.
- Key-value databases can be used to store and retrieve high scores and rankings for online games.
- Key-value databases can be used to store data that is distributed across multiple machines, such as distributed hash tables or distributed key-value stores.
- Key-value databases can be used to store and retrieve content such as images, videos and audio.
- Key-value databases can be used to store and retrieve product information, such as description, prices and inventory levels.

## Topic 1 Reflections


## Consolidation Task 1
Reflect on the dramatic decrease in storage costs over the decades and the strategic implications of this trend for data-driven decision-making within the context of the HR department.
- For HR the impact is that it's far more accessible for a business to use data driven stratagies. A HR data team can use data to understand the workforce, turnover and market behaviours in a way that can be utilised for data driven decision making.

Consider how this data-centric approach could be replicated or adapted to enhance decision-making and operational efficiency in other sectors. 
- Data driven decision making can be used by any company. For example a flower shop with a website could use data for understanding how customers interact with the website and ultimately improve the service. They could also look at the distribution of the products to provide a better service.

Write a brief analysis in your learning journal, focusing on potential impacts on your organisation. 
- In Telecoms data is huge. Better understanding out customers is key to success in very competitive markets. We focus on having a robust data infrastructure to extract data from various source and transform it into something that can be utilised for modelling to create insight on the business.

Identify a stakeholder in your business from whom you could learn more about the effective use of data.
- Personally I think Finance is a department that has a legacy way of working that could benefit from a better understanding of data tools.

Identify a few data sources about competitive trends in the industry, identify the relevant datasets on Google Dataset Search and data marketplaces, and estimate their dataset sizes.
- ![google trends is has data sets for things trending on the internet]([https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=now%201-H&geo=GB&q=technology&hl=en](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=all&geo=GB&q=AI&hl=en))
- I used this to look at interest in technology over time. Size of the dataset would be huge 00's of TB

Also investigate how often this data gets updated and when new data becomes available. Estimate the yearly costs involved in storing this data.
- Data is updated hourly. Yearly costs would be high. It's difficult to estimate not knowing the size of the full dataset.

## Consolidation Task 2
Reflect on how different storage solutionsâ€”HDFS, key-value stores, and Parquetâ€”can meet the diverse data storage and analysis needs within your organisation.
- We use a range of storage solutions. Cloud storage (uses HDFS) is used for compressed file storage, JSON are used in IaC for table schemas, parquet format is used in bigquery tables and CSVs are used for some output files for non technical users to explore in excel.

Consider the impact of these technologies on data accessibility, analytics capabilities, and overall strategic objectives.
- These technologies allow for a huge amount of accessible data opening the door for a range of analytics and data science use cases. The aim of this is the leverage this data to get insight into business performance and customer behaviour.

Identify a specific data challenge in your organisation and propose a storage solution that addresses this challenge, outlining the benefits and any potential limitations.
- With huge amounts of data. Data storage cost is a big concern. One solution to solve bigquery costs is to move from a pay per query model to a capped slot allowance per day. This will make engineers think differently about how they build their processes to make them as cost effective and slot light as possible.

## Consolidation Task 3
Reflect on a recent project or a data challenge within your organisation.
- Migrating to GCP from on-prem.

How might the choice between HDFS, key-value stores, and Parquet influence the outcome of this project? 
- It would influence the speed of data retrieval and also the way the data can be used by analytics/data science teams.

Consider factors such as data volume, query performance requirements, and the nature of the data (structured vs. unstructured).
- With large volumes and query performance gains you'll want to use structured data. For fast retrieval key-value pairs might work better.

Identifying a stakeholder in your business who could provide further insights or feedback on your proposed solution.
- Solution architects.
