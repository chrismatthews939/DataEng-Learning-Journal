Stakeholder engagement in a logistics data project

TransLogix, a global logistics company, launched a project to optimise its delivery routes using data analytics. The project required input from multiple departments:

- **Operations:** To provide data on delivery schedules and vehicle usage.
- **IT:** To integrate analytics tools into the companyâ€™s existing systems.
- **Finance:** To evaluate cost savings from route optimisation.

The challenges they faced included the following:

- **Misaligned Goals:** Operations prioritised efficiency, while Finance focused on cost reductions, causing conflicting expectations.
- **Technical Communication Gaps:** IT struggled to explain the complexities of integrating analytics tools to non-technical stakeholders.
- **Low Stakeholder Involvement:** Key stakeholders from Operations were excluded from early decision-making, leading to resistance in later stages.

So, how did the company address these issues?

Here is a breakdown of the steps they took:

1. **Stakeholder Mapping:** The project team identified all stakeholders, categorised their influence and interest, and developed tailored communication strategies.
2. **Collaborative Governance:** Stakeholder representatives were included in the governance committee to align goals and ensure collaboration.
3. **Proactive Updates:** Weekly updates were shared with stakeholders using visual dashboards and reports tailored to their roles.

**The outcomes**

The project resulted in improved alignment across departments, which facilitated better collaboration and communication.
This, in turn, led to increased stakeholder buy-in, significantly reducing resistance to the changes being implemented.

Ultimately, the successful implementation of the analytics tools achieved a 15% reduction in delivery costs, demonstrating the effectiveness of the project and its positive impact on the organisation's operations.
