# Identifying Relevant Compliance Standards and Regulations

## Case study example - Compliance challenges in a financial services company

A global financial services provider manages sensitive customer data across multiple regions. With operations in Europe, North America, and Asia, the organisation faces a complex compliance landscape, including GDPR, CCPA, and SOX regulations. Their challenges included:

1. Inconsistent regional practices: Different teams used varying data retention policies, creating compliance risks.
2. Data breaches: A lack of encryption for some customer data led to a costly breach.
3. Auditing difficulties: Without clear documentation, the company struggled during regulatory audits.

So, how did the company address these issues?

### The Solution

The company implemented a unified compliance framework, appointing compliance officers in each region.

This included standardised encryption practices, a global data catalog to track data lineage, and automated compliance monitoring tools.

The result was a 40% improvement in regulatory audit success and a significant reduction in data-related risks (King & Schwarzenbach, 2020).

## Key Compliance Standards

### GDPR

The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) focuses on protecting personal data and privacy for individuals within the European Union.

It ensures that organisations process data lawfully, minimise data usage to what is necessary, and secure explicit consent from users.

GDPR also provides individuals the "right to be forgotten," which allows them to request the deletion of their personal data (Eryurek & Gilad, 2021).

### CCPA

In the United States, the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) empowers California residents to control their personal data.

Organisations must be transparent about data collection, allow users to opt out of data sales, and ensure accountability for protecting personal information (Reis & Housley, 2022).

### DPA
The Data Protection Act (DPA) in the UK complements GDPR but includes specific updates for the UK post-Brexit.

### HIPAA
For health data, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) applies in the US.

HIPAA mandates strict security controls, such as data encryption and access limitations, to protect sensitive medical information and requires organisations to report data breaches promptly (Eryurek & Gilad, 2021).

### Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX)
The Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX) ensures that financial records in public companies are accurate and retained securely.

Meanwhile, the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) focuses on protecting payment card information and ensuring secure transactions (King & Schwarzenbach, 2020).
